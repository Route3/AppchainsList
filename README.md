</p>


# How do I contribute?

# Why make Appchainslist?

- We are strong believers of the Appchain and multichain theses
- We believe the best way to facilitate their adoption by new Web3 projects is to provide clear and unopinionated insight into the population of different ecosystems
- We want to have projects of the future choosing where to deploy based on their neighbouring appchains, a metric that is elusive to projects starting out now

This is for everyone.
